# About Me

Based in Pune, India, I'm a Software Engineer with a Computer Engineering background. My professional journey has been shaped by working with modern technologies like Ruby, Rails, Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, and Google Cloud Platform. I'm passionate about open-source development and have made contributions to notable projects including Rails, Rubocop, and Swagger UI Engine. I'm also proud to be a maintainer of the pdf_scanner Ruby gem.

As a developer, I thrive on transforming innovative ideas into reality through clean, efficient code. Beyond coding, I'm constantly exploring emerging technologies and sharing my knowledge through technical blog posts and educational YouTube content. I believe in giving back to the developer community through open-source contributions and mentoring aspiring developers.
