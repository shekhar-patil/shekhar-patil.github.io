When I first heard about \u201cdistroless,\u201d I assumed it was just another buzzword in the container world \u2014 until I actually started using it in production.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nIn this post, I\u2019ll share what distroless containers are, their advantages and disadvantages, the challenges I faced during migration, and a few lessons learned along the way.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What Are Distroless Containers?\\n\\nA **distroless container** is a Docker image that does not include a full Linux distribution like Ubuntu, Debian, or Alpine.\\nInstead, it only contains what your application actually needs to run \u2014 your **compiled binary** and its **runtime dependencies**.\\n\\nThat\u2019s it:\\n- No shell (`bash`)\\n- No package manager (`apt`, `yum`)\\n- No unnecessary system tools or libraries\\n\\nGoogle popularized the concept through their [Distroless project](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless), focusing on making containers **smaller, more secure, and production-optimized**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why Go Distroless?\\n\\nWhen I began exploring distroless images, my main motivation was **security and performance**, but I soon discovered other benefits that made the migration worthwhile.\\n\\n- **Reduced Attack Surface** \u2014 Without shells or package managers, attackers have little to exploit. They can\u2019t simply exec into your container and run arbitrary commands.\\n- **Smaller Image Size** \u2014 Removing unnecessary OS layers makes images significantly lighter, leading to faster builds, pulls, and deployments.\\n- **Faster Startup and Pull Times** \u2014 Smaller images mean quicker startups, which is especially helpful in Kubernetes where pods often restart or scale rapidly.\\n- **Simplified Dependency Management** \u2014 You include only the dependencies your app truly needs, nothing more.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What\u2019s Missing (The Disadvantages)\\n\\nDistroless containers simplify production deployments but introduce some trade-offs.\\n\\n### No Shell Access\\nYou can\u2019t just `docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash` anymore.\\nFor teams that rely on in-container debugging, this can feel restrictive.\\n\\n> **Tip:** Use *debug sidecars* or temporarily swap your base image with a non-distroless version when troubleshooting.\\n\\n### Harder Debugging and Troubleshooting\\nNo `curl`, `netcat`, `ps`, or `top`. You\u2019ll need to invest in better observability \u2014 structured logging, health probes, and metrics become your main debugging tools.\\n\\n### Additional Build Complexity\\nSince distroless containers only hold your final binary, you\u2019ll need **multi-stage builds** to compile and package your app separately.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## My Migration Experience \u2014 Challenges and Learnings\\n\\nWhen we began migrating existing services to distroless containers, I ran into several practical challenges that weren\u2019t obvious at first.\\n\\n### Replacing Shell Scripts\\n\\nOur older containers depended heavily on shell scripts for:\\n\\n- Setting environment variables\\n- Running database migrations\\n- Checking dependencies before startup\\n\\nWith no shell available, these scripts had to go.\\n\\n**Solution:** I rewrote many of them in **Go**.\\nThis made the startup logic type-safe, testable, and independent of any external shell.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Old startup.sh\\n#!/bin/bash\\necho \\"Waiting for database...\\"\\nuntil nc -z $DB_HOST 5432; do\\n  sleep 1\\ndone\\necho \\"Database is up!\\"\\n./app\\n````\\n\\nConverted to Go:\\n\\n```go\\npackage main\\n\\nimport (\\n    \\"fmt\\"\\n    \\"net\\"\\n    \\"os\\"\\n    \\"time\\"\\n)\\n\\nfunc waitForDB(host string, port string) {\\n    for {\\n        conn, err := net.DialTimeout(\\"tcp\\", net.JoinHostPort(host, port), 2*time.Second)\\n        if err == nil {\\n            conn.Close()\\n            fmt.Println(\\"Database is up!\\")\\n            return\\n        }\\n        fmt.Println(\\"Waiting for database...\\")\\n        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n    waitForDB(os.Getenv(\\"DB_HOST\\"), \\"5432\\")\\n    // Start app here\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis made each container self-contained and fully distroless-compatible.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Using Init Containers for Legacy Tasks\\n\\nSome older scripts were too complex to rewrite right away.\\nFor those, I used **Kubernetes init containers** (based on lightweight images like Alpine or Debian) to handle:\\n\\n* Database migrations\\n* Configuration setup\\n* Any one-time initialization logic\\n\\nAfter the init container finished, the main service ran inside the **distroless container**.\\nThis hybrid approach helped us migrate gradually without blocking releases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Debugging Without a Shell\\n\\nDebugging was initially tough. The usual \u201c`docker exec` into the pod\u201d approach no longer worked.\\n\\nHere\u2019s what helped:\\n\\n* Running **debug tools** inside ephemeral containers (`kubectl debug`)\\n* Adding **structured logs** with proper log levels\\n* Setting up **readiness and liveness probes** for better observability\\n\\nEventually, I relied less on manual debugging and more on telemetry and metrics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Multi-Stage Docker Builds\\n\\nHere\u2019s a typical multi-stage Dockerfile I used after migration:\\n\\n```dockerfile\\n# Stage 1: Build the binary\\nFROM golang:1.23 AS builder\\nWORKDIR /app\\nCOPY . .\\nRUN go build -o main .\\n\\n# Stage 2: Run using a distroless base\\nFROM gcr.io/distroless/base-debian12\\nWORKDIR /\\nCOPY --from=builder /app/main /\\nUSER nonroot:nonroot\\nENTRYPOINT [\\"/main\\"]\\n```\\n\\nThis approach kept the final image small, secure, and free from unnecessary build tools.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Lessons Learned\\n\\n* **Pin image digests** instead of tags \u2014 distroless images are updated frequently.\\n* **Run as non-root** \u2014 distroless supports `nonroot:nonroot` users out of the box.\\n* **Use consistent base images** across services to simplify maintenance.\\n* **Document startup logic** \u2014 once shell scripts are removed, clarity becomes vital for future maintainers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\n\\nMigrating to distroless containers isn\u2019t just a technical refactor \u2014 it\u2019s a **mindset shift**.\\nYou stop treating containers as mini operating systems and start treating them as **immutable application packages**.\\n\\nThe transition can feel challenging, especially if your workflows depend on shell utilities, but the benefits in **security**, **performance**, and **consistency** make it absolutely worth it.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re planning to go distroless:\\n\\n* Start with one or two services.\\n* Keep a debug-friendly fallback.\\n* Refactor incrementally.\\n\\nBy the end, your containers will be lighter, faster, and truly production-ready."},{"id":"terminate-goroutines","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/terminate-goroutines","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-30-terminate-goroutine/index.md","title":"How to Terminate Goroutines in Go","description":"This week, I explored goroutines in more depth, particularly focusing on how to terminate them gracefully.","date":"2025-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Golang","permalink":"/blog/tags/golang","description":"Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google..."},{"inline":true,"label":"Design Pattern","permalink":"/blog/tags/design-pattern"},{"inline":true,"label":"Concurrency","permalink":"/blog/tags/concurrency"}],"readingTime":2.26,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Shekhar Patil","title":"Full stack developer.","url":"https://github.com/shekhar-patil","github":"shekhar-patil","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shekhar-patil-834462135/","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16961675?s=400&u=70e54719e239d1148c24bc8661a72ee9e59f420d&v=4","key":"shekhar-patil","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"terminate-goroutines","title":"How to Terminate Goroutines in Go","authors":"shekhar-patil","tags":["golang","Design Pattern","Concurrency"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Migrating to Distroless Containers \u2014 My Real World Journey","permalink":"/blog/distroless-migration"},"nextItem":{"title":"Introducing My New Ruby Gem - PDFScanner","permalink":"/blog/scan-pdf-files-with-pdfscanner-gem"}},"content":"This week, I explored goroutines in more depth, particularly focusing on how to terminate them gracefully.\\n\\n### How to Terminate Goroutines in Go?\\n\\nIn Go, goroutines cannot be forcefully killed. Instead, they should be terminated **gracefully and in a controlled manner**.\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\nYou can achieve this using mechanisms such as **channels**, **context**, or a **shared flag**. Among these, using `context` is the most recommended and idiomatic way.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Method 1: Using `context.Context`\\n\\nUse `context.WithCancel` when you want to manually signal cancellation. When `cancel()` is called, all goroutines observing that context will receive a signal via `<-ctx.Done()`.\\n\\n```go\\npackage main\\n\\nimport (\\n    \\"context\\"\\n    \\"fmt\\"\\n    \\"sync\\"\\n    \\"time\\"\\n)\\n\\nfunc worker(ctx context.Context, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {\\n    defer wg.Done()\\n\\n    for {\\n        select {\\n        case <-ctx.Done():\\n            fmt.Println(\\"Worker cancelled:\\", ctx.Err())\\n            return\\n        default:\\n            fmt.Println(\\"Working...\\")\\n            time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())\\n    var wg sync.WaitGroup\\n\\n    wg.Add(1)\\n    go worker(ctx, &wg)\\n\\n    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)\\n    cancel()\\n    wg.Wait()\\n\\n    fmt.Println(\\"All workers done\\")\\n}\\n````\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou can also use other context-based methods:\\n\\n#### `context.WithTimeout(parent Context, timeout time.Duration)`\\n\\nThis automatically cancels the context after the specified duration.\\n\\n```go\\nctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second)\\ndefer cancel()\\n\\ngo func(ctx context.Context) {\\n    <-ctx.Done()\\n    fmt.Println(\\"Timed out:\\", ctx.Err()) // Prints after 2 seconds\\n}(ctx)\\n```\\n\\n#### `context.WithDeadline(parent Context, deadline time.Time)`\\n\\nThis cancels the context at a specific time. It\'s similar to `WithTimeout`, but instead of a duration, you provide an exact deadline.\\n\\n```go\\ndeadline := time.Now().Add(3 * time.Second)\\nctx, cancel := context.WithDeadline(context.Background(), deadline)\\ndefer cancel()\\n\\ngo func(ctx context.Context) {\\n    <-ctx.Done()\\n    fmt.Println(\\"Deadline reached:\\", ctx.Err())\\n}(ctx)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Method 2: Using Channels to Signal Termination\\n\\nThis is another clean and idiomatic approach in Go.\\n\\n```go\\npackage main\\n\\nimport (\\n    \\"fmt\\"\\n    \\"sync\\"\\n    \\"time\\"\\n)\\n\\nfunc worker(ch chan bool, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {\\n    defer wg.Done()\\n\\n    for {\\n        select {\\n        case <-ch:\\n            fmt.Println(\\"Worker cancelled\\")\\n            return\\n        default:\\n            fmt.Println(\\"Working...\\")\\n            time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n    ch := make(chan bool)\\n    var wg sync.WaitGroup\\n\\n    wg.Add(1)\\n    go worker(ch, &wg)\\n\\n    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)\\n    ch <- true\\n\\n    wg.Wait()\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Method 3: Using a Shared Variable (Not Recommended)\\n\\nWhile possible, this method is generally discouraged unless necessary, as it can be prone to race conditions if not handled properly.\\n\\n```go\\npackage main\\n\\nimport (\\n    \\"fmt\\"\\n    \\"sync\\"\\n    \\"sync/atomic\\"\\n    \\"time\\"\\n)\\n\\nfunc worker(stop *int32, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {\\n    defer wg.Done()\\n\\n    for {\\n        if atomic.LoadInt32(stop) == 1 {\\n            fmt.Println(\\"Worker cancelled.\\")\\n            return\\n        }\\n        fmt.Println(\\"Working...\\")\\n        time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n    var stop int32\\n    var wg sync.WaitGroup\\n\\n    wg.Add(1)\\n    go worker(&stop, &wg)\\n\\n    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)\\n    atomic.StoreInt32(&stop, 1)\\n\\n    wg.Wait()\\n    fmt.Println(\\"All workers done\\")\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nGraceful termination of goroutines is a fundamental part of writing robust concurrent code in Go. Use:\\n\\n* `context` for structured and scalable cancellation\\n* `channels` for simple signaling\\n* shared flags with caution and proper synchronization\\n\\nEach method has its own use case, but **context-based cancellation is the most idiomatic and scalable** approach in modern Go applications."},{"id":"scan-pdf-files-with-pdfscanner-gem","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/scan-pdf-files-with-pdfscanner-gem","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-20-pdf-scanner-gem/index.md","title":"Introducing My New Ruby Gem - PDFScanner","description":"PDF files can contain much more than text and images \u2014 they may include JavaScript, embedded files, form inputs, or even malicious payloads.

But over time, I realized failures are just as important. They teach us, humble us, and help others feel less alone in their journey.\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\nThis post is about my experience interviewing at Google. I made it to the final round but didn\u2019t get the offer. It hurt, but I also learned a lot. I\u2019m sharing my journey in hopes that it helps you prepare better.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How It Started\\n\\nI applied through the [Google Careers](https://careers.google.com/) page around mid-November 2024.. This time, instead of the usual rejection email, I got a call from a Google recruiter\u200a\u2014\u200aa promising start. He scheduled first Screening Call.\\n\\n## Initial HR Round: The Screening Call\\n\\nThe recruiter asked about my education, experience, projects, the tech I\u2019ve worked with, and the scale of systems I\u2019ve built. It was a standard screening call\u2014until they asked:\\n\\n**\\"Have you done any competitive programming?\\"**\\n\\nAt the time, I had solved around 90 problems on LeetCode, mostly Easy and Medium. I was honest and asked for a month to prepare before the next step.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How Google Evaluates Candidates\\n\\nBefore getting into the rounds, it\u2019s helpful to know how Google evaluates you. After each interview, feedback is given as one of these:\\n\\n- Strong No Hire\\n- No Hire\\n- Leaning No Hire\\n- Leaning Hire\\n- Hire\\n- Strong Hire\\n\\nOnly consistent \\"Hire\\" or \\"Strong Hire\\" ratings lead to an offer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Elimination Round\\n\\nI used the one-month prep time to study hard. I solved over 250 DSA problems, mostly on LeetCode and AlgoExpert. You can see my full preparation here:\\n\ud83d\udcd8 [DSA Roadmap](https://www.shekhar-patil.github.io/docs/data-structures-and-algorithms/dsa-roadmap)\\n\\nThe round was a live coding interview with three graph problems, all linked together. I had to solve and code them in a Google Doc.\\n\\nThis round went well\u2014I solved everything. Three days later, the recruiter called:\\n\\n> \\"You cleared the elimination round. Feedback is positive.\\"\\n\\n**Probable rating:** *Hire / Strong Hire*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Technical Round 1: Low-Level System Design\\n\\nI was given a real-world scenario and asked to design core functionality using appropriate data structures. I solved it using arrays with **O(N\xb2)** time complexity.\\n\\nThe interviewer asked if I could optimize it, but under pressure, I couldn\u2019t. After the interview, I realized a **Binary Search Tree (or Red-Black Tree)** could reduce it to **O(N log N)**.\\n\\n**Probable rating:** *Leaning Hire*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Technical Round 2: HashMap-Based Problem\\n\\nThis round focused on implementing a solution using HashMaps. I misunderstood the problem at first, which cost time. After clarification, I fixed the code in the last 15 minutes.\\n\\nThe interviewer spotted a **bug**, though the majority of my solution was correct.\\n\\n**Probable rating:** *Leaning Hire / Hire*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Technical Round 3: Graph Problem\\n\\nThis round was tricky. I took some time to understand the problem and realized it involved **cycle detection in a graph**.\\n\\nI made mistakes in the beginning, and it took me about **35 minutes** to get the solution right. Then I did a quick dry run in the another 5 minutes. The interviewer confirmed my final solution was correct. He had a follow-up question, but we ran out of time.\\n\\n**Probable rating:** *Leaning Hire*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Result\\n\\nI had mixed feelings\u2014both excited and nervous. It had been almost three months of continuous effort, and I was very close to the final stage. The next round was the Googliness interview, which is mostly a behavioral round, and many people usually clear it without much trouble.\\n\\nTwo weeks later, the recruiter called and said:\\n\\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be moving forward. The feedback mentioned that you should use more optimal data structures, and your problem-solving speed needs improvement. But feel free to reapply after a year.\u201d\\n\\nIt was disappointing to hear, especially after coming so far. But I didn\u2019t see it as a failure. Here\u2019s why.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What I Gained\\n\\nThe whole process took almost **3-4 months**, and in that time:\\n\\n- I moved from **Ruby** to **Golang** (You can start Golang Here https://www.shekhar-patil.github.io/docs/golang/intro)\\n- I developed a strong understanding of low level system design and data structures\\n- I solved hundreds of problems and built my roadmap here https://www.shekhar-patil.github.io/docs/data-structures-and-algorithms/dsa-roadmap\\n- I learned what top-tier companies really look for: correctness, speed, clarity, and optimality\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Takeaways for You\\n\\n1. **Know your best language:** I chose Go, but I\'m more fluent in Ruby. In time-bound interviews, using a language you\u2019re super comfortable with makes a big difference.\\n2. **Manage your time:** Getting the right answer isn\u2019t enough. Google looks at how quickly and efficiently you solve problems.\\n3. **Simulate real interview conditions:** Use a timer. Code in a shared doc. Practice talking while solving.\\n4. **Learn from mistakes:** Every small mistake taught me something valuable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \u2705 What\u2019s Next?\\n\\nI\u2019m not giving up. I\u2019ll reapply in a year. Till then, I\u2019m focused on:\\n\\n- Advanced system design\\n- Distributed systems\\n- Speeding up problem-solving\\n- Real-world contributions\\n- Mastering Go and revisiting Ruby\\n\\nIf you\'re preparing for Google or any FAANG interview, check out my:\\n\\n- \ud83d\udcd8 [DSA Roadmap](https://www.shekhar-patil.github.io/docs/data-structures-and-algorithms/dsa-roadmap)\\n- \u270d\ufe0f [All My Blogs](https://www.shekhar-patil.github.io/blog)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83c\udf10 Explore More\\n\\n- \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb [My Website & Projects](https://www.shekhar-patil.github.io)\\n- \ud83d\udcda [Golang Learning Path](https://www.shekhar-patil.github.io/docs/golang/intro)\\n- \ud83e\udde0 [DSA Roadmap](https://www.shekhar-patil.github.io/docs/data-structures-and-algorithms/dsa-roadmap)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude4c Final Thoughts\\n\\nNot getting into Google stung\u2014but the journey changed me.

We can use rake tasks in Rails for various purposes.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nRake is inspired by Linux [make utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)). Its name comes from the `Ruby Make`. Rake is a task management utility that reads and executes the tasks defined in the ruby language in the \'Rakefile`. It was written by the late [Jim Weirich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Weirich).\\n\\n# How to create a Rake task.\\n\\nCreate a file with the name \'Rakefile\' and write the following content in it.\\n` $ touch Rakefile`\\n\\n```\\ndesc \'print hello world\'\\ntask :hello_world do\\n  puts \'Hello world from Rubyist\'\\nend\\n```\\nHere `desc` command defines the description of the task and `task` command defines the actual task that needs to be executed. Here we are defining a simple task which is printing \\"Hello world from Rubyist.\\".\\n\\nIf you are in the directory containing the Rakefile then you can execute the following commands:\\n```\\n$ rake --task              This command will show all the tasks defined in the Rakefile along with its description.\\n=> rake hello_world        # Print hello world\\n```\\n\\nNow we can execute the task using the following command\\n```\\n$ rake hello_world\\n=> Hello world from Rubyist\\n```\\nWe can also use namespace while defining the Rake task add the following code to Rakefile:\\n```\\ndesc \'Display files from the current directory\'\\nnamespace :admin do\\n  task :display_files do\\n    system(\'ls\')\\n  end\\nend\\n```\\nLet\'s see all tasks once again:\\n```\\n$ rake --task\\n=> rake admin:display_files  # Display files from the current directory\\n   rake hello_world          # print hello world\\n```\\nWe can execute this task as follows:\\n```\\n$ rake admin:hello_world\\n(It should display files from your current directory)\\n```\\nNamespacing to rake task is always good when the number of tasks is more and also it separates the context of the task.\\n\\n\\nIn the Rails project we can see many rake tasks as following:\\n\\n* rails db:migrate\\n* rails routes\\n* rake tmp:clear\\n* rake tmp:create\\n\\nWe can find out many more tasks by executing `rake --task` command in the Rails application root directory.\\n\\n## How to define custom rake tasks in Rails?\\n\\nWe can create file with `.rake` extension in `/lib/tasks/` folder.\\n\\n```\\n# lib/tasks/clear_logs.rake\\n\\nnamespace :Logs do\\n  desc \'clear the log files\'\\n  task clear: :environment do\\n    Dir[\\"log/*.log\\"].each do |file|\\n       File.unlink(file)\\n    end\\n  end\\nend\\n```\\nAbove task is deleting all files from `log directory`.\\n\\nNow we can simply execute this task as following:\\n```\\n$ rake Logs:clear\\n```\\n\\nI

permission denied for the table.\\n\\nTo solve this issue use the following steps:\\n\\n* Open your Postgres console with the following command:\\n\\n  `sudo su - postgres` followed by `psql`\\n\\n* Now use `\\\\du` command to check users and their permissions.\\n\\n```\\npostgres=# \\\\du\\n                                      List of roles\\n   Role name    |                         Attributes

can see root user don\'t have any permission\\n\\nNow grant the following permissions to the `root` user.\\n\\n```\\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE dev_db_name to root;\\npostgres=# ALTER USER root WITH SUPERUSER CREATEDB BYPASSRLS;\\n```\\nyou can read more about the Privileges in PostgreSQL [Here](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/postgresql/how-to/modify-user-privileges/).\\n\\nI

Using `print`\\n\\n```ruby\\nprint \'hello world\'\\nhello world => nil\\n```\\n\\nYou must have observed there is some difference in every output.\\n\\n#### Few observations:\\n\\n1. puts and print has return `nil` while p has return the input we have passed to it.\\n2. p has shown output in string format.\\n3. return value of puts and p has printed on next line and for print return value is on same line.\\n\\n### Let\'s take one more example for better understanding:\\n\\nNow we create one file with extension .rb and paste below given code in that file.\\n\\n1.Example of puts:\\n\\n```ruby\\nA = \'I\'\\nB = \'Love\'\\nC = \'Ruby\'\\n\\nputs A\\nputs B\\nputs C\\n```\\nNow we can run this file using `ruby filename.rb` in the terminal and before running this command confirm that you are in the same directory where you have created ruby file.\\n\\noutput of above code will be as following\\n\\nOutput of puts:\\n\\n```ruby\\nI\\nLove\\nRuby\\n```\\n\\nNow we will execute same code for print and p.\\n\\n2.Using print\\n\\n```ruby\\nA = \'I\'\\nB = \'Love\'\\nC = \'Ruby\'\\n\\nprint A\\nprint B\\nprint C\\n```\\nOutput of print:\\n```\\nILoveRuby\\n```\\n\\n3.Using p.\\n\\n```ruby\\nA = \'I\'\\nB = \'Love\'\\nC = \'Ruby\'\\n\\np A\\np B\\np C\\n```\\nOutput of p:\\n```\\n\\"I\\"\\n\\"Love\\"\\n\\"Ruby\\"\\n```\\n\\nNow you must have more clarity about all of this methods.\\n\\nLet\'s conclude the blog:\\n\\n1. puts: puts add newline character at the end of the output. that is why we got return value `nil` on the next line.\\n\\n2. print: print does not add newline character at the end of output because of that the return value of print that is `nil` is printed on the same line where output is printed.\\n\\n3. p: p does not change data type of the input provided to it. if we are passing string type of input it also prints the string type of output.

Merge two objects having distinct attributes names.\\n\\ndeclare two objects as the following:\\n```javascript\\nvar student = { \\n  student_name: \\"Rahul\\", \\n  age: 22, \\n  standard: \\"6th\\" \\n};\\n\\nvar school = { \\n  school_name: \\"SBK high school\\", \\n  location: \\"Pune\\" \\n};\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\nNow, we will use `extend` method to merge these two objects.\\n\\n```javascript\\n$.extend(student, school);\\n\\n> {student_name: \\"Rahul\\", age: 22, standard: \\"6th\\", school_name: \\"SBK high school\\", location: \\"Pune\\"}\\n```\\n\\nWe can also use the `merge` method to merge these objects\\n\\n```javascript\\n$.merge(student, school);\\n\\n> { student_name: \\"Rahul\\", age: 22, standard: \\"6th\\", length: undefined}\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Merge two objects having some common attributes names.\\n\\nWe don\'t have to care where there are distinct attributes in the objects. But when there are some common attribute names then those attributes value gets an override.\\n\\n\\ndeclare two objects having the same attribute names like the following:\\n```javascript\\nvar student = { \\n  name: \\"Rahul\\", \\n  age: 22, \\n  standard: \\"6th\\" \\n};\\n\\nvar school = { \\n  name: \\"SBK high school\\", \\n  location: \\"Pune\\" \\n};\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\nNow, we will use `extend` method to merge these two objects.\\n\\n```javascript\\n$.extend(student, school);\\n\\n> {name: \\"SBK high school\\", age: 22, standard: \\"6th\\", location: \\"Pune\\"}\\n```\\n\\nWe can also use the `merge` method to merge these objects\\n\\n```javascript\\n$.merge(student, school);\\n\\n> {name: \\"Rahul\\", age: 22, standard: \\"6th\\", length: undefined}\\n```\\n\\nNow we have understood how to merge two objects in Javascript and the difference between merge and extend method in Javascript. We should be careful while merging two objects having a common attribute name. Common attribute names can cause unexpected result in the output.\\n\\nPlease feel free to contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Shekharpatil95)."},{"id":"singleton-method-in-the-ruby","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/singleton-method-in-the-ruby","source":"@site/blog/2019-08-10-singleton-method-in-the-ruby.md","title":"How to use a Singleton method in the rails.","description":"Today I attend Ruby Conference at Pune and Singleton method and metaclass in ruby was one of the talk discussed there So, I thought to write a blog about it.","date":"2019-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Rails","permalink":"/blog/tags/rails","description":"Ruby on Rails is a server-side web application framework..."}],"readingTime":1.67,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Shekhar Patil","title":"Full stack developer.","url":"https://github.com/shekhar-patil","github":"shekhar-patil","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shekhar-patil-834462135/","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16961675?s=400&u=70e54719e239d1148c24bc8661a72ee9e59f420d&v=4","key":"shekhar-patil","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"singleton-method-in-the-ruby","title":"How to use a Singleton method in the rails.","authors":"shekhar-patil","tags":["rails"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Extend, Merge methods in the Javascript.","permalink":"/blog/how-to-merge-objects-in-javascript"},"nextItem":{"title":"Scope in rails.","permalink":"/blog/scope-in-rails"}},"content":"Today I attend Ruby Conference at Pune and Singleton method and metaclass in ruby was one of the talk discussed there So, I thought to write a blog about it.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nIn ruby, we create the class and class has many methods written into it. When we create an object of the class we can access those methods using that object. So, the question raise in my mind was as follows.\\n\\n### 1. Who holds these methods? does class hold these methods or each object of the class holds this methods? \\n\\nLet us find it out.\\n\\n```ruby\\nclass User\\n  def role\\n    puts \\"Admin\\"\\n  end\\nend\\n\\nuser = User.new\\nuser.role         // Admin\\n\\nclass User\\n  def role\\n    puts \\"sales\\"\\n  end\\nend\\n\\nuser.role         // sales\\n```\\n\\nAs we can see we have overridden the `User` class that is why second `user.role` prints `sales`. It means all class methods are implemented in the class and also it is store in the class definitions.\\n\\nNow consider the situation where we want to create method only for a single object of the class not for all objects of the class. We can do it in the ruby using singleton methods for the class object.\\n\\n## 2. Singleton methods\\n\\nSingleton methods are the methods which are only available for a single particular object and not for all objects of the class.\\n\\nCheck the following snippet\\n\\n```ruby\\nclass User\\n  def role\\n    puts \\"Admin\\"\\n  end\\nend\\n\\nfirst_user = User.new      \\nfirst_user.role              // Admin\\n\\n// Add singleton method department for `first_user` object.\\ndef first_user.department\\n  puts \'Admin department\'\\nend\\nfirst_user.department        // Admin department\\n\\nsecond_user = User.new\\nsecond_user.role             // Admin\\nsecond_user.department       // NoMethodError (undefined method `department\' for #<User:0x000055a8b44b45d0>)\\n```\\n\\nWe can observe that department method is not available for object `second_user` because the department is singleton method for object `first_user` so it is stored on the metaclass of an object and they are independent of the parent class of the object.\\n\\nSo, Object in ruby only stores the state. Its behavior comes from the class definition. The metaclass is almost similar to a class but it can\'t be instantiated."},{"id":"scope-in-rails","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/scope-in-rails","source":"@site/blog/2019-06-13-scope-in-rails.md","title":"Scope in rails.","description":"Rails follow the DRY principle of software development and that is \'Don\'t Repeat Yourself\'.","date":"2019-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Rails","permalink":"/blog/tags/rails","description":"Ruby on Rails is a server-side web application framework..."}],"readingTime":1.53,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Shekhar Patil","title":"Full stack developer.","url":"https://github.com/shekhar-patil","github":"shekhar-patil","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shekhar-patil-834462135/","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16961675?s=400&u=70e54719e239d1148c24bc8661a72ee9e59f420d&v=4","key":"shekhar-patil","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"scope-in-rails","title":"Scope in rails.","authors":"shekhar-patil","tags":["rails"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to use a Singleton method in the rails.","permalink":"/blog/singleton-method-in-the-ruby"},"nextItem":{"title":"Relational database.","permalink":"/blog/relational-database"}},"content":"Rails follow the DRY principle of software development and that is \'Don\'t Repeat Yourself\'.\\nScopes are great to keep our code DRY and well organized.

So, we can simply write the following query\\n\\n```ruby\\n\\ndef index\\n  @active_users = User.where(status: \\"active\\")\\nend\\n```\\n\\nBut we may need to re-use this code multiple times in our project. So instead of writing the same code, again and again, we can define a scope for it.\\n\\n```ruby\\nclass user < ActiveRecord::Base\\n  scope :active, -> { where(status: \\"active\\") }\\nend\\n```\\n\\nNow, we can simply use an active scope to fetch all active users as following:\\n\\n```ruby\\ndef index\\n  @active_users = User.active\\nend\\n```\\n\\n## 1.

[[\\"LIMIT\\", 10]]\\nCollege Load (0.2ms) SELECT \\"colleges\\".* FROM \\"colleges\\" WHERE \\"colleges\\".\\"id\\" = ? LIMIT ?

[[\\"id\\", 2], [\\"LIMIT\\", 1]]\\n```\\n\\nCurrently, There are 11 independent queries to fetch 10 students. One query to fetch students and other N queries to fetch college in each iteration. hence the total number of queries is N+1. Now are fetching just 10 records but in the real-time scenario, the number of required records can be large. Suppose we want to fetch 10000 records then we\'ll need to connect database 10001 times and it will degrade the performance of the application heavily.\\n\\n## Eager loading in Rails\\n\\nTo avoid the performance degradation of the previous example we need to reduce the number of independent queries to the database. In rails, this is done by eager loading associated relations. In the eager loading, we collect the required data with only one query.\\n\\n```sql\\nstudents = Student.includes(:college).limit(10)\\n\\nstudents.each do |student|\\n  puts \\"#{student.college.name} build number #{student.name}\\"\\nend\\n```\\nThis time we\'ll use one query to fetch the students and another for fetching the associated colleges.\\n```sql\\nStudent Load (0.4ms) SELECT \\"students\\".* FROM \\"students\\"\\nCollege Load (0.4ms) SELECT \\"colleges\\".* FROM \\"colleges\\" WHERE \\"colleges\\".\\"id\\" IN (?, ?, ?, ?) [[\\"id\\", 1], [\\"id\\", 2], [\\"id\\", 3], [\\"id\\", 4]]\\n```\\nNow, we\'ll required only two queries. Even though we wanted 10000 records only two queries are required to fetch the records from the database and it will improve the performance of our application.\\n\\nFor comparison, the time necessary to load and display 10 builds in my system is 2.1 milliseconds without eager loading and only 0.8 milliseconds with eager loading. This is s huge difference. Currently, In the case of a large number of record fetching, this time difference can be even far more.\\n\\nI would love to hear some of your tips on dealing with N+1 queries on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Shekharpatil95).\\n\\nCheers!"},{"id":"first-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/first-blog-post","source":"@site/blog/2019-01-04-first-post.md","title":"First Blog Post","description":"This is my first post, how exciting!!","date":"2019-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.04,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Shekhar Patil","title":"Full stack developer.","url":"https://github.com/shekhar-patil","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16961675?s=400&u=70e54719e239d1148c24bc8661a72ee9e59f420d&v=4","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16961675?s=400&u=70e54719e239d1148c24bc8661a72ee9e59f420d&v=4","socials":{},"key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"first-blog-post","title":"First Blog Post","authors":{"name":"Shekhar Patil","title":"Full stack developer.","url":"https://github.com/shekhar-patil","image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16961675?s=400&u=70e54719e239d1148c24bc8661a72ee9e59f420d&v=4","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16961675?s=400&u=70e54719e239d1148c24bc8661a72ee9e59f420d&v=4"},"tags":[]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Eager loading and N+1 query in rails.","permalink":"/blog/eager-loading-and-N-plus-1-query"}},"content":"This is my first post, how exciting!!"}]}}')}}]);
