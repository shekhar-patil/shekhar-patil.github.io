![Google Interview](./google.webp)

Like many of us, I used to only share the good stuff — job offers, achievements, career milestones. But over time, I realized failures are just as important. They teach us, humble us, and help others feel less alone in their journey.

This post is about my experience interviewing at Google. I made it to the final round but didn’t get the offer. It hurt, but I also learned a lot. I’m sharing my journey in hopes that it helps you prepare better.

## How It Started

I applied through the [Google Careers](https://careers.google.com/) page around mid-November 2024.. This time, instead of the usual rejection email, I got a call from a Google recruiter — a promising start. He scheduled first Screening Call.

## Initial HR Round: The Screening Call

The recruiter asked about my education, experience, projects, the tech I’ve worked with, and the scale of systems I’ve built. It was a standard screening call—until they asked:

**"Have you done any competitive programming?"**

At the time, I had solved around 90 problems on LeetCode, mostly Easy and Medium. I was honest and asked for a month to prepare before the next step.

## How Google Evaluates Candidates

Before getting into the rounds, it’s helpful to know how Google evaluates you. After each interview, feedback is given as one of these:

- Strong No Hire  
- No Hire  
- Leaning No Hire  
- Leaning Hire  
- Hire  
- Strong Hire

Only consistent "Hire" or "Strong Hire" ratings lead to an offer.

## The Elimination Round

I used the one-month prep time to study hard. I solved over 250 DSA problems, mostly on LeetCode and AlgoExpert. You can see my full preparation here:  
📘 [DSA Roadmap](https://www.shekharpatil.tech/docs/data-structures-and-algorithms/dsa-roadmap)

The round was a live coding interview with three graph problems, all linked together. I had to solve and code them in a Google Doc.

This round went well—I solved everything. Three days later, the recruiter called:

> "You cleared the elimination round. Feedback is positive."

**Probable rating:** *Hire / Strong Hire*

## Technical Round 1: Low-Level System Design

I was given a real-world scenario and asked to design core functionality using appropriate data structures. I solved it using arrays with **O(N²)** time complexity.

The interviewer asked if I could optimize it, but under pressure, I couldn’t. After the interview, I realized a **Binary Search Tree (or Red-Black Tree)** could reduce it to **O(N log N)**.

**Probable rating:** *Leaning Hire*

---

## Technical Round 2: HashMap-Based Problem

This round focused on implementing a solution using HashMaps. I misunderstood the problem at first, which cost time. After clarification, I fixed the code in the last 15 minutes.

The interviewer spotted a **bug**, though the majority of my solution was correct.

**Probable rating:** *Leaning Hire / Hire*

---

## Technical Round 3: Graph Problem

This round was tricky. I took some time to understand the problem and realized it involved **cycle detection in a graph**.

I made mistakes in the beginning, and it took me about **35 minutes** to get the solution right. Then I did a quick dry run in the another 5 minutes. The interviewer confirmed my final solution was correct. He had a follow-up question, but we ran out of time.

**Probable rating:** *Leaning Hire*

## The Result

I had mixed feelings—both excited and nervous. It had been almost three months of continuous effort, and I was very close to the final stage. The next round was the Googliness interview, which is mostly a behavioral round, and many people usually clear it without much trouble.

Two weeks later, the recruiter called and said:

“We won’t be moving forward. The feedback mentioned that you should use more optimal data structures, and your problem-solving speed needs improvement. But feel free to reapply after a year.”

It was disappointing to hear, especially after coming so far. But I didn’t see it as a failure. Here’s why.

## What I Gained

The whole process took almost **3-4 months**, and in that time:

- I moved from **Ruby** to **Golang** (You can start Golang Here https://www.shekharpatil.tech/docs/golang/intro)  
- I developed a strong understanding of low level system design and data structures  
- I solved hundreds of problems and built my roadmap here https://www.shekharpatil.tech/docs/data-structures-and-algorithms/dsa-roadmap
- I learned what top-tier companies really look for: correctness, speed, clarity, and optimality

## 🛠️ Key Takeaways for You

1. **Know your best language:** I chose Go, but I'm more fluent in Ruby. In time-bound interviews, using a language you’re super comfortable with makes a big difference.
2. **Manage your time:** Getting the right answer isn’t enough. Google looks at how quickly and efficiently you solve problems.
3. **Simulate real interview conditions:** Use a timer. Code in a shared doc. Practice talking while solving.
4. **Learn from mistakes:** Every small mistake taught me something valuable.

## ✅ What’s Next?

I’m not giving up. I’ll reapply in a year. Till then, I’m focused on:

- Advanced system design  
- Distributed systems  
- Speeding up problem-solving  
- Real-world contributions  
- Mastering Go and revisiting Ruby

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

Not getting into Google stung—but the journey changed me. I learned more in three months than I had in the past year. If you’re going through something similar, just know this: you’re not alone, and every setback is a setup for growth.
